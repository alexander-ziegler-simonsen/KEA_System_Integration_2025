Baseball and the other modern ", " – ", ", ", " and ", " – were developed from folk games in early Britain, Ireland, and Continental Europe (such as France and Germany). Early forms of baseball had a number of names, including \"base ball\", \"goal ball\", \"round ball\", \"fetch-catch\", \"stool ball\", and, simply, \"base\". In at least one version of the game, teams pitched to themselves, runners went around the bases in the opposite direction of today's game, much like in the Nordic ", ", and players could be put out by being hit with the ball. Just as now, in some versions a batter was called out after three strikes.\n", "Although much is unclear, as one would expect of children's games of long ago, this much is known: by the mid-18th century a game had appeared in the south of England which involved striking a pitched ball and then running a circuit of bases. Rounders is referenced in 1744 in the children's book ", " where it was called Base-Ball.", " English colonists took this game to North America with their other pastimes, and in the early 1800s variants were being played on both sides of the ocean under many appellations.  However, the game was very significantly altered by amateur men's ball clubs in and around New York City in the middle of the 19th century, and it was this heavily revised sport that became modern baseball.\n", "A number of folk games in ", " and ", " had characteristics that can be seen in modern ", " (as well as in ", " and ", "). Many of these early games involved a ball that was thrown at a target while an opposing player defended the target by attempting to hit the ball away. If the batter successfully hit the ball, he could attempt to score points by running between bases while fielders would attempt to catch or retrieve the ball and put the runner out. \nFolk games differed over time, place, and culture, resulting in similar yet variant forms. These games had no standard documented rules and instead were played according to historical customs. These games tended to be played by working classes, peasants, and children. Early folk games were often associated with earlier religious ceremonies and worship rituals. These games became discouraged and even altogether prohibited by subsequent governing states and religious authorities.", "\n", "Aside from obvious differences in terminology, the games differed in the equipment used (ball, bat, club, target, etc., which were usually just whatever was available), the way in which the ball was thrown, the method of scoring, the method of making outs, the layout of the field and the number of players involved. Very broadly speaking, these games can be roughly divided into forms of ", ", where the batter ran out to a single point or line and back, as in cricket, and ", ", where there was a circuit of multiple bases. There were also games (e.g. stool-ball, trap-ball) which involved no running at all.\n", "Oină is a Romanian traditional sport, a form of ", " similar in many ways to ", ".\n", "The name \"oină\" was originally \"hoina\",", " and is derived from the ", " word ", " \"game\" (a cognate of Turkish ", ").", " \nThe oldest direct mention comes from 1364.", "\n", "In 1899, ", ", the minister of education decided that oină was to be played in schools in ", " classes.

The earliest known reference to stoolball is in a 1330 poem by ", ", who recommended to priests that the game be forbidden within churchyards.\n", "In stoolball, one player throws the ball at a target while another player defends the target. Originally, the target was defended with a bare hand. Later, a bat of some kind was used (in modern stoolball, a bat like a very heavy ", " paddle is used). \"Stob-ball\" and \"stow-ball\" were regional games similar to stoolball. What the target originally was in stoolball is not certain; it was possibly a tree stump, since \"", "\" and \"", "\" all mean ", " in some local dialects. (\"", "\" could also refer to a type of frame used in mining). It is notable that in cricket to this day, the uprights of the ", " are called \"stumps\". Of course, the target could well have been whatever was convenient, perhaps even a gravestone (hence Pagula's objection to churchyard play). A 17th-century book on games specifies a stool.\n", "According to one legend, milkmaids played stoolball while waiting for their husbands to return from the fields. Another theory is that stoolball developed as a game played after attending church services, in which case the target was probably a church stool. An 18th-century poem depicts men and women playing together (the women using their aprons to catch batted balls), and it and other references associate the game especially with the Easter season.", "\n", "There were several versions of stoolball. In the earliest versions, the object was primarily to defend the stool. Successfully defending the stool counted for one point, and the batter was out if the ball hit the stool. There was no running involved. Another version of stoolball involved running between two stools, and scoring was similar to the ", ". In perhaps yet another version there were several stools, and points were scored by running around them as in baseball.\n", "When Englishmen came to America, they brought stoolball with them. ", " in his diary for Christmas Day, 1621, noted (with disapproval) how the men of Plymouth were \"frolicking in þe street, at play openly; some pitching þe barre, some at stoole-ball and shuch-like sport\".", " Because of the different versions of stoolball, and because it was played not only in England, but also in colonial America, stoolball is considered by many to have been the common ancestor of cricket, baseball and rounders.\n", "In tut-ball or pize-ball,", " which was similar to both stoolball and rounders, the corners of the infield were marked by \"tuts\" (sods or pieces of brick that marked the bases) rather than stools, and the batter generally hit with their hand.", "\n", "Another early folk game was \"dog and cat\" (or \"cat and dog\"), which probably originated in Scotland. In cat and dog an oblong piece of wood called a ", " is thrown at a hole in the ground while another player defends the hole with a stick (a ", "). In some cases there were two holes and, after hitting the cat, the batter would run between them while fielders would try to get the runner out by putting the cat in the hole before the runner got to it. Dog and cat thus resembled cricket.\n", "This game, otherwise unknown, was described in ", " (ca. 1670), which included rules for over 130 pastimes including stool-ball and stow-ball.", " It is significant in that it involved both a bat and base-running, although it was played with a wooden cat rather than a ball and the multiple \"bases\" were holes in the ground: the batter reached safety by putting the end of his bat in a hole before the fielders could put the cat in it. This has echoes in cricket's manner of scoring runs by touching the bat to the ground across the ", " before the fielders can hit the nearby wicket with the ball.", "\n", "In trap ball, played in England since the 14th century, a ball was thrown in the air, to be hit by a batsman and fielded. In some variants a member of the fielding team threw the ball in the air; in some, the batter tossed it himself as in fungo; in others, the batsman caused the ball to be tossed in the air by a simple lever mechanism: versions of this, called ", " and ", ", are still played in some English pubs. In trap-ball there was no running, instead the fielders attempted to throw the ball back to within a certain distance of the batter's station. Trap-ball may be the origin of the concept of foul lines; in most variants the ball had to be hit between two posts to count.\n", "A related game was tip-cat; in this, the \"cat\" was an oblong piece of wood (as in dog-and-cat); it tapered toward each end, rather like a rugby ball or American football, so that striking one end would flip it into the air much like the trap in trap-ball so that it could be struck with a stick or bat.\n", "An old English game called \"", "\" or \"", "\", described by George Ewing at ", ", was apparently not much like baseball. There was no bat and no ball involved. The game was more like a fancy game of team \"tag\", although it did share the concept of places of safety, bases, with baseball.\n", "The ", " prior to 1650 is something of a mystery.

Bat, base, and ball games for two teams that alternate in and out, such as baseball, cricket, and rounders, are likely to be close cousins.

Often, as in English tip-cat, there was no pitcher and the \"cat\" was not a ball but an oblong wooden object, roughly football-shaped, which could be flipped into the air by striking one end, or simply a short stick which could be placed over a hole or stone and similarly flipped up. In other variants the batter himself tossed the ball into the air with his free hand, as in fungo. A feature of some versions of cat that would later become a feature of baseball was that a batter would be out if he swung and missed three times.\n", "Another game that was popular in early America was \"one ol' cat\", the name of which was possibly originally a contraction of ", ".", " In one ol' cat, when a batter is put out, the catcher goes to bat, the pitcher catches, a fielder becomes the pitcher, and other fielders move up in rotation. One ol' cat was often played when there weren't enough players to choose up sides and play townball. Sometimes running to a base and back was involved. \"Two ol' cat\" was the same game as one ol' cat, except that there were two batters; a diagram preserved in the New York Public Library is labeled \"Four Old Cat\" and depicts a square field like a baseball diamond and four batters, one at each corner.\n", "There are numerous 18th and early 19th-century references in England and especially America to \"bat and ball\". Unfortunately, there is no knowledge and information about the game besides the name, nor whether it was an alternate term for baseball or something else such as trap-ball, cat or even cricket.

Doubleday himself never made such a claim; he left many letters and papers, but they contain no description of baseball or any suggestion that he considered himself prominent in the game's history. His ", " obituary makes no mention of baseball, nor does a 1911 Encyclopædia article about Doubleday. The story was attacked by baseball writers almost as soon as it came out, but it had the weight of Major League Baseball and the Spalding publishing empire behind it. Contrary to popular belief, Doubleday was never inducted into the ", ", although a large oil portrait of him was on display at the Hall of Fame building for many years.\n", "Doubleday's invention of baseball was the finding of a panel appointed by ", ", a former star pitcher and club executive, who had become the leading American sporting goods entrepreneur and sports publisher. Debate on baseball's origins had raged for decades, heating up in the first years of the 20th century, due in part to a 1903 essay baseball historian ", " wrote in ", "'s ", " stating that baseball gradually evolved from English game of “", "”.", " To end argument, speculation, and innuendo, Spalding organized the ", " in 1905.

Sullivan.", "\n", "The final report, published on December 30, 1907, included three sections: a summary of the panel's findings written by Mills, a letter by ", " supporting the panel, and a dissenting opinion by ", ". The research methods were, at best, dubious. Mills was a close friend of Doubleday, and upon Doubleday's death in 1893 Mills orchestrated his memorial service and burial.", " Doubleday had been a prominent member of the spiritualist ", ", in which Spalding's wife was deeply involved and in whose compound in San Diego Spalding was residing at the time. Wright and Reach were effectively Spalding's employees, as he had secretly bought out their sporting-goods businesses some years before.  AAU president and Commission secretary Sullivan was Spalding's personal factotum. Several other members had personal reasons to declare baseball as an \"American\" game, such as Spalding's strong ", " views.", " The Commission found an appealing story: baseball was invented in a quaint rural town without foreigners or industry, by a young man who later graduated from ", " and served heroically in the ", ", ", ", and U.S. wars against Indians.\n", "The Mills Commission concluded that Doubleday had invented baseball in ", " in 1839; that Doubleday had invented the word \"baseball\", designed the diamond, indicated fielders' positions, and written the rules. No written records in the decade between 1839 and 1849 have ever been found to corroborate these claims, nor could Doubleday be interviewed (he died in 1893). The principal source for the story was one letter from elderly ", ", who was a five-year-old resident of Cooperstown in 1839. Graves never mentioned a diamond, positions or the writing of rules. What's more, his reliability as a witness was challenged because he spent his final days in an asylum for the criminally insane.  Doubleday was not in Cooperstown in 1839 and may never have visited the town.", " He was enrolled at ", " at the time, and there is no record of any leave time. Mills, a lifelong friend of Doubleday, never heard him mention baseball, nor is there any mention of the game in Doubleday's autobiography. In character, Doubleday was bookish and sedentary, with no observable interest in athletics of any sort.\n", "Versions of baseball rules and descriptions of similar games have been found in publications that significantly predate his alleged invention in 1839. Despite this, the ballpark built in 1939 only a few blocks down from the Hall of Fame still bears the name \"Doubleday Field\". However, aside from the artificial intrusion of the person of Doubleday and the village of Cooperstown, the Mills report was not entirely incorrect in its broad outline: a game related to English rounders was played in America from early times; it was supplanted by a variant form which originated in New York circa 1840. But this development happened in urban New York City, not pastoral Cooperstown, and the men involved were neither farm boys nor West Point cadets.\n", "The earliest known published", " rules of baseball in the United States were written in 1845 for a New York City \"base ball\" club called the ", ".", " The purported organizer of the club, ", ", is one person commonly known as \"the father of baseball\". The rules themselves were written by the two-man Committee on By-Laws, Vice-president ", " and Secretary ", ". One important rule, the 13th, outlawed \"soaking\" or \"plugging\", putting a runner out by hitting him with a thrown ball, introducing instead the concept of the tag; this reflected the use of a farther-traveling and potentially injurious hard ball.", " Another significant rule, the 15th, specified three outs to an inning for the first time instead of \"one out, all out\" or \"all out, all out.\"  The 10th rule prescribed foul lines and foul balls and the 18th forbade runners advancing on a foul, unlike the \"Massachusetts game\" in which all batted balls were in play. The Knickerbockers also enlarged the diamond well beyond that of town ball, ", " to modern size depending on how \"paces\" is interpreted.", "\n", "Evolution from the so-called \"", "\" to the current rules is fairly well documented. The most significant differences were that overhand pitching was illegal, strikes were only counted if the batter swung and missed, \"wides\" or balls were not counted at all, a batted ball caught on the first bounce was an out, and a game was played to 21 \"aces\" or runs rather than for a set number of innings.\n", "It is noteworthy, however, that the Knickerbocker Rules did not cover a number of basic elements of the game. For example, there was no mention of positions or the number of players on a side, the pitching distance was unspecified, the direction of base-running was left open, and it was never stated, though implied, that an \"ace\" was scored by crossing home plate. In all likelihood, all of these matters except the first were considered so intrinsic to baseball by this time that they were assumed; the number of players on a side, however, remained a matter of debate among clubs", " until fixed at nine in 1857, the Knickerbockers arguing unsuccessfully for seven-man teams.\n", "On June 3, 1953, Congress officially credited Cartwright with inventing the modern game of baseball.  He was already a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1938 for various other contributions to baseball. However, the role of Cartwright himself in the game's invention has been disputed. According to ", "'s official historian, John Thorn, \"Cartwright's plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame declares he set the bases 90 feet apart and established nine innings as a game and nine players as a team. He did none of these things, and every other word of substance on his plaque is false.\"", " His authorship may have been exaggerated in a modern attempt to identify a single inventor of the game, and heavily advanced by a relentless public-relations campaign by his grandson. The 1845 Rules themselves are signed by the \"Committee on By-Laws\", ", " and ", ". There is evidence that these rules had been experimented with and used by New York ball clubs for some time; Cartwright, in his 1848 capacity as club secretary (and a bookseller), was merely the first to have them printed up.\n", " Further evidence of a more collective model of New York baseball's development, and doubts as to Cartwright's role as \"inventor\", came with the 2004 discovery of a newspaper interview with ", ", a founding member of the Gotham Baseball Club in 1837 and first vice president of the Knickerbocker Club, and co-author of its rules, eight years later.\n", "\n", "\n", "If Wheaton's account, given in 1887, was correct, then most of the innovations credited to Cartwright were, in fact, the work of the Gothams before the Knickerbockers were formed, including a set of written rules. John Thorn, ", "'s official historian, argued in his book ", " that four members of the Knickerbockers, namely Wheaton, ", ", ", " and ", ", have stronger claims than Cartwright as \"inventors\" of modern baseball.", "\n", "Legend holds that Cartwright also introduced the game in most of the towns where he stopped on his trek west to California to find gold, a sort of Johnny Appleseed of baseball. This story, however, arose from forged entries in Cartwright's diary which were inserted after his death.\n", "It is however certain that Cartwright, a New York bookseller who later caught ", ", umpired a game in Hoboken, New Jersey on June 19, 1846.  The game ended, and the Knickerbockers' opponents (the New York nine)", " won, 23–1. This was long believed to be the first recorded U.S. baseball game between organized clubs. However, at least three earlier reported games have since been discovered: on October 10, 1845, a game was played between the New York Ball Club and an unnamed", " club from Brooklyn, at the Union Star Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn; the New Yorks lost 22 to 1. The game was reported in the ", " and ", ", making it the first ever published baseball result. The New Yorks and Brooklyns played two more games on October 21 and 24, with the first on the New Yorks' home diamond at Elysian Fields and the rematch at the Star Cricket Grounds again.", "\n", "One point undisputed by historians is that the modern professional major leagues that began in the 1870s developed directly from the amateur urban clubs of the 1840s and 1850s, not from the pastures of small towns such as Cooperstown.\n", "In 1845, the ", " began using ", " in ", " to play ", ", following the New York and Magnolia Ball Clubs which had begun playing there in 1843.\n", "At a preliminary meeting [of the Knickerbockers], it was suggested that as it was apparent they would soon be driven from Murray Hill, some suitable place should be obtained in New Jersey, where their stay could be permanent; accordingly, a day or two afterwards, enough to make a game assembled at Barclay street ferry, crossed over, marched up the road, prospecting for ground on each side, until they reached the Elysian Fields, where they \"settled.\"", "On October 21, 1845, the New York Ball Club played the second of their three games against a Brooklyn team there, the series being the first known inter-club baseball games. In June 1846 the Knickerbockers played the \"New York nine\" (probably the same New York Ball Club) in the first baseball game played between clubs according to codified rules.

In 1852, the Eagle Club published their rules, and two years later the Knickerbockers, Eagles and Gothams met and agreed to a uniform set of rules to govern all three clubs, at least in match play, which for the first time set the pitching distance (15 paces). A preliminary meeting in 1855 between seven other clubs, five from New York and one each from Brooklyn and New Jersey,", " represented the first effort to form an organized league, although it came to nothing. However, in 1857 sixteen clubs from New York and environs sent delegates to a convention that standardized the rules, essentially by agreeing to the unified Knickerbocker-Gotham-Eagle rules with certain revisions: rather than playing to a set number of runs, games would consist of nine innings, and force-outs could now occur at any base. The convention also defined the distance between the bases unambiguously as 90 feet, and specified nine-man teams.", " The following year, twenty-five clubs including one from New Jersey established an ongoing governing body with officers, constitution and by-laws, but the ", " is conventionally dated from the first meeting in 1857.

Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman (Vance was two years older than Ball). Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the time that there should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the star of the show, would be it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance's work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness.

Seeing a lucrative opportunity and the chance to star in his own show, Frawley was enthused. Vance, however, declined for a number of reasons, the biggest factor being that she felt she and Frawley could barely work together on the ensemble show they were doing at the time, so it would be much less likely the two could work together on their own series. Vance also felt that the Mertz characters would not be as successful without the Ricardos to play off of, and despite being her biggest success, she was becoming interested in playing more glamorous roles rather than Ethel.

Similar to Jonson's \"To Penshurst\", Marvell's poem is describing a pastoral estate.  It moves through the house itself, its history, the gardens, the meadows and other grounds, the woods, the river, his Pupil Mary, and the future.

During this time period Ambrose Philips, who is often overlooked because of Pope, modeled his poetry after the native English form of Pastoral, employing it as a medium to express the true nature and longing of Man.  He strove to write in this fashion to conform to what he thought was the original intent of Pastoral literature.  As such, he centered his themes around the simplistic life of the Shepherd, and, personified the relationship that humans once had with nature.

A notable part of Paradise Lost is book IV where he chronicles Satan's trespass into paradise. Milton's iconic descriptions of the garden are shadowed by the fact that we see it from Satan's perspective and are thus led to commiserate with him. Milton elegantly works through a presentation of ", "’s pastorally idyllic, eternally fertile living conditions and focuses upon their stewardship of the garden. He gives much focus to the fruit bearing trees and Adam and Eve's care of them, sculpting an image of pastoral harmony. However, Milton in turn continually comes back to ", ", constructing him as a character the audience can easily identify with and perhaps even like. Milton creates Satan as character meant to destabilize the audience’s understanding of themselves and the world around them. Through this mode, Milton is able to create a working dialogue between the text and his audience about the ‘truths’ they hold for themselves.\n", "Italian writers invented a new genre, the pastoral romance, which mixed pastoral poems with a fictional narrative in prose.

However, Shakespeare plays with the bounds of pastoral idealization. Throughout the play, Shakespeare employs various characters to illustrate ", ". His protagonists ", " and ", " metaphorically depict the importance of the coexistence of realism and idealism, or urban and rural life. While Orlando is absorbed in the ideal, Rosalind serves as a mediator, bringing Orlando back down to reality and embracing the simplicity of pastoral love.

Notable examples include the shepherd's \"alte Weise\" from ", "'s ", ", or the pastoral ballet occupying the middle of ", "'s ", ".

These include ", ",", " ", ",", " ", ",", " ", ",", " ", ",", " ", ",", "  Annabel Patterson,", " Paul Alpers,", " and Ken Hiltner.", " ", " was one of the first Pastoral theorists. He did not see the form as merely a recording of a prior rustic way of life but a guise for political discourse, which other forms had previously neglected. The Pastoral, he writes, has a didactic duty to \"contain and enforme morall discipline for the amendment of mans behaviour\".", "\n", " linked the Pastoral to childhood and a childlike simplicity. For Schiller, we perceive in nature an \"image of our infancy irrevocably past\".", " ", " spoke of the ideal of Pastoral as being embedded in varying degrees of ambivalence, and yet, for all the apparent dichotomies, and contradicting elements found within it, he felt there was a unified harmony within it. He refers to the pastoral process as 'putting the complex into the simple.' Empson argues that \"... good proletarian art is usually Covert Pastoral\", and uses Soviet Russia's propaganda about the working class as evidence.  Empson also emphasizes the importance of the double plot as a tool for writers to discuss a controversial topic without repercussions.\n", " argues that the foundation of the pastoral lies in the idea that the city is a highly urban, industrialized center that has removed us from the peaceful life we once had in the countryside. However, he states that this is really a \"myth functioning as a memory\" that literature has created in its representations of the past. As a result, when society evolves and looks back to these representations, it considers its own present as the decline of the simple life of the past. He then discusses how the city's relationship with the country affected the economic and social aspects of the countryside. As the economy became a bigger part of society, many country newcomers quickly realized the potential and monetary value that lay in the untouched land. Furthermore, this new system encouraged a social stratification in the countryside.  With the implementation of paper money came a hierarchy in the working system, as well as the \"inheritance of titles and making of family names\".\n", " was concerned with how death reconciled itself with the pastoral, and thus came up with a loose categorization of death in the pastoral as 'funeral elegy', the most important tropes of which he cites as religion (embodied by Pan); friendship; allegory;and poetic and musical calling. He concedes though that such a categorization is open to much misinterpretation. As well, Poggioli focused on the idea that Pastoral was a nostalgic and childish way of seeing the world. In ", ", he claims that the shepherd was looked up to was because they were \"an ideal kind of leisure class.\"\n", " discusses the pastoral within the historical context of the English Renaissance.  His first condition of pastoral poetry is that it is an urban product. Kermode establishes that the pastoral is derived as an opposition between two modes of living, in the country and in the city. London was becoming a modern metropolis before the eyes of its citizens. The result of this large-scale ", " left the people with a sense of nostalgia for their country way of living.  His next argument focuses on the artificiality of poetry, drawing upon fellow theorist, Puttenham.\n", "Kermode elaborates on this and says, \"the cultivated, in their artificial way, reflect upon and describe, for their own ends, the natural life\". Kermode wants us to understand that the recreation or reproduction of the natural is in itself artificial. Kermode elaborates on this in terms of imitation, describing it as \"one of the fundamental laws of literary history\" because it \"gives literary history a meaning in terms of itself, and provides the channels of literary tradition\". Kermode goes on to explain about the works of Virgil and Theocritus as progenitors of the pastoral. Later poets would draw on these earlier forms of pastoral, elaborating on them to fit their own social context. As the pastoral was becoming more modern, it shifted into the form of Pastourelle.  This is the first time that the pastoral really deals with the subject of love.\n", " emphasizes many important ideas in her work, Pastoral and Ideology. One of these is that the pastoral mode, especially in the later 18th century, was interpreted in vastly different ways by different groups of people. As a result, distinctive illustrations emerged from these groups which were all variations of the understanding of Virgil's Eclogues. Patterson explains that Servius' Commentary is essential to understanding the reception of Virgil's Eclogues. The commentary discusses how poets used analogy in their writings to indirectly express the corruption within the church and government to the public. When speaking of post-Romanticism, it is imperative to take into consideration the influence and effect of ", " on pastoral ideology. His poem, ", " is a critique of war and also a suggestion that pastoral, as a literary mode, should not place emphasis on social and political issues, but should rather, as Patterson says, \"turn in upon itself, and replace reformist instincts with personal growth and regeneration\". ", " was a highly respected poet in the 1800s and his poem, ", " published in 1805, was an excellent example of what a dream of a new golden age might materialize as or look like.\n", "Paul Alpers, in his 1996 book, ", ", describes the recurring plot of pastoral literature as the lives of shepherds.  With William Empson's notion of placing the complex into the simple, Alpers thus critically defines pastoral as a means of allegory.  Alpers also classifies pastoral as a mode of literature, as opposed to a genre, and he defines the attitude of pastoral works maintaining a humble relationship with nature.  Alpers also defines pastoral convention as the act of bringing together, and authors use this to discuss loss. He says the speakers in pastoral works are simple herdsmen dramatized in pastoral encounters.\n", "However, authors like Herrick changed the herdsmen to nymphs, maidens, and flowers. Thus, achieving a mode of simplicity but also giving objects voice. This is done by personifying objects like flowers.  Moreover, authors that do this in their works are giving importance to the unimportant. Alpers talks about pastoral lyrics and love poems in particular. He says \"a lyric allows its speaker to slip in and out of pastoral guise and reveal directly the sophistication which prompted him to assume it in the first place″. In other words, he claims pastorals lyrics have both pastoral and not pastoral characteristics, perhaps like in the comparisons between urban and rural, but they always give importance to and enhance on the pastoral. Alpers talks about love poems and how they can be turned into pastoral poems simply by changing words like lover to shepherd.  And he mentions Shakespeare as one of the authors who did this in his works. Furthermore, Alpers says the pastoral is not only about praise for the rural and the country side. For instance, Sidney dispraises the country life in ", ".  Pastoral can also include the urban, the court, and the social like in ", ".\n", "Alpers says that pastoral narration contradicts \"normal\" narrative motives and that there is a double aspect of pastoral narration: heroic poetry and worldly realities with narrative motives and conventions. And in respect to pastoral novels, Alpers says pastoral novels have different definitions and examples depending on the reader. Also, the pastoral novel differs from Theocritus and Virgil's works. He says there are pastoral novels of the country life, of the longing for the simple, and with nature as the protagonist. And says the literary category of pastoral novels is realistic and post-realistic fiction with a rural theme or subject based on traditional pastoral.\n", "In ", ", Ken Hiltner argues that Renaissance pastoral poetry is more often a form of ", " than critics like Paul Alpers and Annabel Patterson give it credit for. He explains that even though there is a general lack of lavish description in Renaissance pastoral, this is because they were beginning to use gestural strategies, and artists begin to develop an environmental consciousness as nature around them becomes endangered. Another argument presented in the book is that our current environmental crisis clearly has its roots in the Renaissance. To do this we are shown examples in Renaissance pastoral poetry that show a keen awareness of the urban sprawl of London contrasted to the countryside and historical records showing that many at the time were aware of the issue of urban growth and attempted to stop it.\n"]},
